# üîÅ Predicting Customer Churn Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project uses a **Random Forest Classification model** to predict customer churn for a telecommunications company. Understanding and anticipating churn is critical to reducing revenue loss. By identifying which customers are likely to cancel their service, the company can intervene with targeted retention strategies like loyalty offers, service improvements, or support outreach.

**Research Question:**  
Which customers are likely to churn, and what characteristics make them high-risk?

## Methodology
- **Random Forest Classification** was used to predict churn based on features such as income level, service plan, customer support usage, and account tenure.

## Key Findings
-	The model achieved a final accuracy of 77%, making it a strong baseline for churn prediction.
- Customers with low engagement, short tenure, and frequent support interactions were the most likely to churn.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- scikit-learn
